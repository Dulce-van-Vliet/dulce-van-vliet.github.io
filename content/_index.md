# <hello!>


I am a historian interested in the cultural dimensions of media, science, and technology. I earned my PhD at Utrecht University as part of the research project Projecting Knowledge, where I produced the first large-scale survey of public lantern lectures in Dutch society from the late nineteenth century to the Second World War. I currently hold a postdoctoral position in the Technology, Innovation & Society group at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I investigate historical sustainability trade-offs connected to the industrialization of the Netherlands.
