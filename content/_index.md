## hello!


I am a historian interested in the cultural dimensions of media, science, and technology--from anaglyph stereoscopic 3D and magic lanterns to the history of the large sociotechnical systems that shape our lives today. I currently work as a postdoc researcher in the Technology, Innovation & Society group at Eindhoven University of Technology.
