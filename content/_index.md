# Hi,

I'm Dulce van Vliet, a historian with broad interests and a background in media production. I am currently a postdoc researcher in the Technology, Innovation & Society group at Eindhoven University of Technology.

My research focuses on historical sustainability trade-offs connected to the industrialization of the Netherlands. 

I have a PhD in media and cultural history from Utrecht University, where I investigated the role of the magic lantern in science popularization and knowledge dissemination.
